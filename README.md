Mandelbrot Fractal Viewer
------------------------
This program generates a Mandelbrot fractal and includes an interactive zoom feature, 
enabling detailed exploration of the fractal. Developed in C++ using Visual Studio, 
it is based on concepts from the "Advanced C++" course by Cave of Programming. 
The number of iterations, color scheme, and zoom level are fully customizable, allowing for a tailored fractal experience.

When you ran it, it takes some seconds or minutes depending on number of iterations to generate the .bmp file
To find the desired coordinates in which to zoom I use GIMP to see the coordinates in the bitmap.

If you love this type of mathematics visualization this program will surely be fun to mess around. 

How to run
-
Downloading Visual Studio and using the clone repository option is the easiest option. You can also do it manually with GCC/Clang and the Command promt, I don't really know how to do that so you'll need to search for a tutorial on how to run github repositories like that.
